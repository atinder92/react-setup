# React Setup
This project helps us to setup up ReactJs application easily.

Webpack is one of the most widely used modules bundler, which enables us to build and deploy front end applications quickly and easily. BabelJs is used with webpack to convert ES6 and JSX code to browser compatible javascript.

The structure of the project is very simple.

* .babelrc          - Babel configuration file
* webpack.config.js - Webpack configuration file
* src               - Folder containing source files
* dist              - Output folder containing bundle.js
